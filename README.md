# ðŸŒ³ ipe

This repository includes the source code for the Ipe compiler, written in Haskell.

It comes with a CLI! You can build Ipe projects by cloning the repo and running it with `stack`:

```bash
stack run -- build examples/Root.ipe -o examples/dist/
```

If you want to see all of the available options:

```bash
stack run -- --help
```

If you speak portuguese and want to know more about the language, [check out my dissertation on it](https://github.com/henriquecbuss/ipe-dissertation)
